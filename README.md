# YNAB Negative Rollover

A script that enables you to rollover your negative balances in [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com). I've contacted YNAB support multiple times to support this natively â€“ they basically said they don't want to (stupid!). So I did it myself using their [API](https://api.youneedabudget.com). It's hacky, but it works for my family. The one downside that I don't really have a workaround for is that it messes up the "activity" total for a category with a rollover amount, as the rollover amount is rendered as a transaction.

## Dependencies

This only has a global dependency on [`node`](http://nodejs.org).

## Initializing the app

To install local dependencies, run `npm i`. Make sure you are providing the app your API token, otherwise it will not work.

You should create a payee called `Budget Rollover`, an account called `Budget Rollover`, and a category called `Rollover Offset`. You can set the inital balance of the account to zero and close it right away, and you can also hide the category after creating it.

### Parameters

`TOKEN`: your YNAB API token. This can also be added in an `index.token` file at the root of `src`.

## Running the app

You can run the app using `npm run start`. Running start runs builds automatically, so if you want to run the app without building, then you need to run `node .` directly.

> If you want to build without running, run `npm run build`.

## Development

You can run the app with livereload enabled by running `npm run watch`.
